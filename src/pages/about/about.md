I am a client side developer, living and working in London UK.

I currently work for [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com). 

I have previously worked for [notonthehighstreet.com](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/), [Proprocure](https://proprocure.com/) and [Hampshire County Council](https://www.hants.gov.uk/).

I am a father of one, and a husband, also of one.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SiAdcock) and [GitHub](https://github.com/SiAdcock) under the imaginative handle `@SiAdcock`. 

I spend a lot of time thinking, talking and listening. I like asking questions then digging to find answers. I have found software development to be about 30% coding and 70% exploring. That said, I still hope one day to become the Guardian Frontend's [number one contributor by commits](https://github.com/guardian/frontend/graphs/contributors).
